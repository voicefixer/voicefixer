# Installation

You can install VoiceFixer from PyPI or directly from the source repository.

::::{warning}
When installing from PyPI, make sure you install `voicefixer2` and not `voicefixer`. Installing `voicefixer` will install the original version of VoiceFixer, which may be incompatible with VoiceFixer 2.
