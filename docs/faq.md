# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is VoiceFixer?

VoiceFixer is a general speech restoration toolkit. VoiceFixer uses AI to remove background noise, fix degraded speech, enhance audio quality from old recordings, upscale audio resolution, and more, all in one model!

## How is VoiceFixer 2 different from VoiceFixer?

VoiceFixer was semi-abandoned several years ago. VoiceFixer 2 takes VoiceFixer to the next level, with Apple Silicon GPU acceleration support. You can visit the original VoiceFixer's websiteÂ [here](https://github.com/haoheliu/voicefixer).

## Is VoiceFixer 2 affiliated with the original VoiceFixer?

No, VoiceFixer 2 is not affiliated with the original creator of VoiceFixer, Haohe Liu. It has been independently forked and improved. We are actively reviewing the code to improve quality and remove direct file links.

## Does VoiceFixer support GPUs?

Yes, VoiceFixer supports GPUs. We support Apple Silicon devices as well as Nvidia GPUs and AMD GPUs using MPS, CUDA, and ROCm respectively.

## Does VoiceFixer support music?

No, VoiceFixer 2 is currently speech-only. It will attempt to filter out background noise and music from speech. For a model that can upscale non-speech audio, please check out [AudioSR](https://github.com/haoheliu/versatile_audio_super_resolution).

## Does VoiceFixer 2 support longer audio?

Yes! VoiceFixer 2 is great for longer audio. It splits audio into chunks and processes them individually. The original VoiceFixer package had no progress bar, so one would have no idea how long processing would take. This has been fixed by the VoiceFixer 2 contributors, and we now feature a progress bar with a time estimation for longer audio files.
