**[Docs](https://voicefixer.github.io/voicefixer/) - [Updates on X](https://twitter.com/voicefixer2)**

Welcome to VoiceFixer 2, the next generation of VoiceFixer. VoiceFixer is a general speech restoration tool, using AI to remove background noise, fix degraded speech, enhance audio quality from old recordings, upscale audio resolution, and more, all in one model!

VoiceFixer aims to restore human speech, regardless of how seriously degraded it is. It can handle noise, reverberation, low resolution, and clipping effect within one model!

## What's different from the original VoiceFixer?

The [original version of VoiceFixer](https://github.com/haoheliu/voicefixer) continues to be updated with minor changes and bug fixes. VoiceFixer 2 adds major new features (including Apple Silicon support, a revamped CLI, and more) and fixes several bugs.

### New features in VoiceFixer 2

We’ve added the following features in VoiceFixer 2:

* We’ve added MPS support, which means you can use GPU acceleration on macOS devices running on Apple Silicon chips.
* Revamped CLI.
* Documentation
* We've added a progress bar through TQDM for longer audio
* We now support non-WAV files (ie MP3)
* We're now using `cached_path` instead of using a hard-coded a cache path to increase OS support
* We're featuring much faster model downloads w/ Hugging Face (the original VoiceFixer models are hosted on Zenodo)
* More features coming soon!

## To-Do

Here's what we still need to do - feel free to contribute:

- [ ] Fine-tune model for better results (this one requires compute - see [this](https://github.com/haoheliu/voicefixer_main) training repo)
- [x] Add MP3 support for folders
- [x] Allow user to restore an object (don't require a file)
- [ ] Allow user to input audio as an audio object, wave object, numpy array, torchaudio object, or pydub object and to output audio in varied formats as well, similar to how Gradio can accept audio in many different formats
- [ ] Update model to make [modifying state dict](https://github.com/voicefixer/voicefixer/commit/1b8c384bc2f34645e72c67e46db92b3accd20613) unnecessary - loading it twice increases VRAM usage (related to latest librosa issue)
    - [ ] Update model
    - [ ] Remove code
- [ ] [Realtime support](https://github.com/haoheliu/voicefixer_main/issues/11)
- [ ] [Add to HF Audio-to-Audio pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-adding-libraries)
- [x] Support Windows (mostly file paths) - maybe use [cached_path](https://github.com/allenai/cached_path)
    - [ ] Fully test on Windows
- [x] Clean up CLI (may have breaking changes)
- [x] Support custom models
- [x] Use latest version of librosa (probably pretty important, here's the issue the model doesn't work with latest torchlibrosa and the old torchlibrosa doesn't work with the latest librosa. need to completely retrain the model probably or change model python file) - fixed thanks to @manmay-nakhashi
- [x] Switch models from Zenodo to Hugging Face to increase speed and control over models (in progress)
- [x] Publish to pip
- [x] Add TQDM progress bar - crucial for longer conversions
- [x] Implement .mp3 support (currently only supports .wav)
- [x] Fix CLI instead of copying to /bin use CLI like [this](https://github.com/fakerybakery/simplesplit/blob/main/setup.py)
